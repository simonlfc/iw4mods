This is my own HUD that I started working on a few months ago. It is fully usable online.

- It is in a usable state but there are still minor issues. If I ever usethis again and find the time to fix them I'll commit the changes here.

- Please keep in mind that this HUD was designed for me and for the paramters I'm used to play with. If you're playing on a 4:3 or 21:9 resolution, it might not work as intended.

- The minimap and score bar is colored depending of the faction you're in: OpFor is yellow, Militia/Septsnaz is red, Rangers is military green, TF141/SEALs is dark blue.

- The entire HUD scales depending of your safe area.

- For the compass at the top to work, you need to create a fastfile with the provided material and load it.
