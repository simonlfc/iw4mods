This is my own HUD that I started working on a few months ago. It is fully usable online.

- **For the compass at the top to work, you need to create a fastfile with the provided material and load it.**

- It is in a usable state but there are still minor issues. If I ever usethis again and find the time to fix them I'll commit the changes here.

- Please keep in mind that this HUD was designed for me and for the paramters I'm used to play with. If you're playing on a 4:3 or 21:9 resolution, it might not work as intended.

- The minimap and score bar is colored depending of the faction you're in: OpFor is yellow, Militia/Septsnaz is red, Rangers is military green, TF141/SEALs is dark blue.

- The entire HUD scales depending of your safe area.

- The [killcam_fullscreen](https://github.com/sortileges/iw4mods/blob/master/ui/ui_mp/killcam_fullscreen.menu) includes some leftover items that let you show the player's perks and weapons. You only have to uncomment those items. [This is how it looks like.](https://i.gyazo.com/66a5970ef480d53deee2397315d67de5.png)
