Only the necessary animations, HUD icons, and weaponfiles are included. It functions just like the ACR from Cliffhanger.

There is a "bug" that makes you reload every time you spawn in, since you spawn with the weapon empty for some reason. I didn't mind it too much so it's still like that, although you can probably fix it yourself..
