An old experiment/attempt of re-creating MW2's Alpha HUD.<br>This is in no way a perfect recreation, but more of a proof-of-concept thing to see what can be done with .menu files.

<b>SOME ELEMENTS WILL NOT WORK ONLINE!!</b> A few elements are changed through various GSC scripts, and cannot be used clientside. All the .menu elements and images do work however.

I also lost the the material files for some of the icons years ago, and I'm very lazy. Feel free to dump the fastfile yourself in case you need them.
